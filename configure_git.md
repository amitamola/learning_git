Certainly! Let's break down the key points from the text you provided:

1. **Checking Git Version:**
   - To verify that Git is installed, open Cloud Shell and type the following command:
     ```
     git --version
     ```
   - You should see output similar to this example:
     ```
     git version 2.7.4
     ```

2. **Configuring Git:**
   - Set your name using the following command (replace `<user>` with your desired username):
     ```
     git config --global user.name "<user>"
     ```
   - Configure your email address with this command (replace `<USER_EMAIL>` with your actual email):
     ```
     git config --global user.email "<USER_EMAIL>"
     ```
   - Confirm your changes by running:
     ```
     git config --list
     ```
   - Ensure that the output includes lines like:
     ```
     user.name=User Name
     user.email=user-name@contoso.com  
     
  3. **Setting Up a Git Repository:**
   - Create an empty folder for your project (e.g., named "Cats"):
     ```
     mkdir Cats
     ```
   - Change to the project directory:
     ```
     cd Cats
     ```
   - Initialize a new Git repository with the default branch named "main":
     - For Git version 2.28.0 or later:
       ```
       git init --initial-branch=main
       ```
     - For earlier Git versions:
       ```
       git init
       git checkout -b main
       ```
   - After initialization, you'll see output like:
     ```
     Initialized empty Git repository in /home/<user>/Cats/.git/
     Switched to a new branch 'main'
     ```

4. **Checking Working Tree Status:**
   - Use the following command to see the status of your working tree:
     ```
     git status
     ```
   - The output will indicate that you're on the "main" branch with no commits yet.

5. **Verifying Git Repository Directory:**
   - Confirm that your project directory contains a `.git` subdirectory (use `ls -a` to show hidden files).
   - The `.git` directory stores metadata and history for your working tree.
